# in-place selection sort

Rearrange
an unordered `ArrayList<Integer>`
and use it as the data in an `OrderedList_inArraySlots`.

The re-use is probably contrary to Java's conventions
for its built-in classes. But as a pedagogical tool,
it has the advantage of allowing
the User program to check that the sort
is done in-place.
